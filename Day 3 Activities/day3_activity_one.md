### @ San Diego SeaWorld Part I (10 am - 1 pm)

  We are going to visit one of the biggest attractions in San Diego, the SeaWorld. In this aquatic theme park, we can enjoy a lot of activities, such as watching killer whale shows, getting an up-close look at some amazing deep-sea creatures, and taking a ride on the "Journey to Atlantis" roller coaster. We will have lunch inside the park.
