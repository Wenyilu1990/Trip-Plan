# Day 3 (Dec 19) Lunch
### @ San Diego SeaWorld (~ 1 pm or any other time if preferred)

  We will have our lunch inside the park. It is all-day dining, meaning that we can have our lunch or brunch or afternoon snack as often as once every hour. There are many in-park restaurants to choose from. So it is impossible to starve. Dining plan for each person costs about $36.
