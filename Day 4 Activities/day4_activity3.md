# Day 4 (Dec 20) Activity 3
### @ Griffith Park ( 13:00 pm - 17:30 pm)

  Griffith Park is one of the largest municipal parks in North America and is
the largest historic landmark in the City of Los Angeles, now covering 4,511 acres.
This storied landmark is a rare example of untouched, natural chaparral
in an urban center. Situated in the eastern Santa Monica Mountains, the
park’s tree-studded canyons are criss-crossed with more than 70 miles of
hiking and equestrian trails that offer unparalleled views of the Los Angeles
basin.
