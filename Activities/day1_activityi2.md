# Day 1 (Dec 17) Activity 2
### @ Sunset Cliff Beach ( 5 - 7:30 pm)

  Hurray! We land in San Diego, at around 4 pm! After picking up our baggages, we take a rental car from theã€€airport to the hotel (Motel 6) we booked. When we have a little rest from the flight, we are going to the Sunset Cliff Beach at around 5 pm, to enjoy the beautiful sunset on the beach of the West coast.
