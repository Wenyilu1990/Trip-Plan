The freshly baked Mexican cakes are filled with freshly fried fish, filled with parsley, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, with a layer of special sauce and lemon juice, a bite seems to be back into the harbor. Santiago's Fish Taco and the fresh Ceviche are well known, after all here is the Mexican border.
