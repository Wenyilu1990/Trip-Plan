Lodging Plan for trip in December
===================

#Hotel booking

Based on the comparisons below, we decided to choose **Motel 6 San Diego Downtown** for all four nights, which takes about $86 per day per room. So the total cost for lodging would be $86*3*4 = $1032, and we would book the rooms on [Hotels.com]: https://www.hotels.com/ho451039/?q-check-out=2017-09-25&FPQ=2&q-check-in=2017-09-24&WOE=1&WOD=7&q-room-0-children=0&pa=1&tab=description&JHR=1&q-room-0-adults=2&YGF=3&MGT=1&ZSX=0&SYE=3
