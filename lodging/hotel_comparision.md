Lodging Plan for trip in December

So the total cost for lodging would be $86 * 3 * 4 = $1032, and we would book the rooms on [Hotels.com]: https://www.hotels.com/ho451039/?q-check-out=2017-09-25&FPQ=2&q-check-in=2017-09-24&WOE=1&WOD=7&q-room-0-children=0&pa=1&tab=description&JHR=1&q-room-0-adults=2&YGF=3&MGT=1&ZSX=0&SYE=3
