**2. Dicission Making**
* After comparision, we decided to park in Renaissance Hotel STL, **_becuase first of all_** the price rate is cheaper than average rate; **_Secondly_** the location is just 1 mile away from the airport; **_Thirdly_** the suttle bust is 24/7 hours, every 20 minutes will have next turn, which means we do not have to hurry.

**3. Total Price for 5 days**
* $22.45

**4. Booking confirmation**
